    			<h2>Welcome to Total Body Balance</h2>
    			<p><strong>Are you struggling with stress, aches and pains and you don’t know where to turn?</strong></p>
    			<p>Are you dealing with symptoms like these?
    			<!-- <img src="images/header.jpg" id="header-image"> -->
    				<ul>
    					<li>Headaches</li>
    					<li>Neck or back pain</li>
    					<li>Chronic pain or movement restrictions anywhere in the body</li>
    					<li>Pain that does not resolve following trauma or a successful surgery</li>
    					<li>Temporomandibular joint pain [TMJ]</li>
    					<li>Tinnitus [ringing in your ears]</li>
    					<li>Abdominal or pelvic pain</li>
    					<li>Poor digestion or constipation</li>
    					<li>Low energy or poor sleep</li>
    					<li>Stress, depression, or feelings of being overwhelmed</li>
    					<li>Poor immune system function</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p><strong>You are not alone.</strong></p>
				<p>Your body tells the story of the stresses in your life, both physical and emotional, accumulated daily or through trauma. Often we don't notice them piling up. As stress mounts our body's ability to heal itself and our ability to deal with daily life decreases.<br>Sometimes we get lost in this process.<br>But there is hope and there is help.</p>

				<p><span class="cs">Craniosacral therapy and myofascial release</span> are gentle manual approaches than can create dramatic improvements in your life.</p>
				
				<p>These techniques focus on reducing the physical and energy tensions and on balancing the whole body. They relax connective tissues and tight muscles, enhance the flow of the body's fluids to allow all the systems in the body to effectively communicate with each other.</p>

				<p><span class="cs">Craniosacral therapy</span> treats the restrictions of the Craniosacral System by gently manipulating and freeing the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Because of the central role that the nervous system plays in the function of the entire body, any restriction of its normal motion can have far-reaching and varied effects.</p>

				<a class="btn btn-success" href="#therapy">Read more about craniosacral therapy</a>

				<p><span class="cs">Myofascial release</span> eliminates the pull of tight fascia and the imbalances created in muscles and joints to alleviate pain and increase mobility.</p>

				<p><span class="cs">Scar tissue mobilization</span> is also used to release the restrictions from superficial to deep fascia and soft tissues that might follow trauma or surgery.</p>

				<p><strong>There is potential within each of us to feel good no matter our age, no matter how chronic the problem.</strong></p>

				<p>A therapist can assist you in reaching your body's optimal balance and help you reclaim your health. As your body regains balance and your progress towards your well-being you can expect:
				<ul>
					<li>Reduced or relieved pain</li>
					<li>Better sleep</li>
					<li>Greater control over your life</li>
					<li>More energy and vitality</li>
					<li>A deeper sense of calm</li>
					<li>The ability to relax and enjoy your life more</li>

    			<h2>About Craniosacral Therapy</h2>
    			<p>CranioSacral Therapy is a light touch, manual technique that relieves deep tensions in the fascia.</p>
    			<p>Fascia is the extensive connective tissue that lines the entire body and envelops everything (in a steak it is the tougher whitish tissue surrounding the red fibers). In the embryo, fascia develops first and all the other structures grow through it: muscles, organs, nerve, brain, cells, etc. Fascia connects throughout the body, in multiple layers and in all directions.</p>

    			<p>In its normal state, fascia glides a few millimeters in all directions, but restrictions can occur. These might be due to trauma to the body such as surgeries, falls, accidents or by accumulated stress and nervous tension. A restriction in one area can affect another part of the body, just like a snag at the bottom of a sweater can show as a bunched up area at the shoulder. When the fascia is compromised it can have profound negative effects on the whole body.</p>

    			<p>The most superficial layer of fascia lies just underneath the skin. It responds to light pressure and allows access to the deeper layers due to its limited elasticity.</p>

    			<p>The deepest layer is the dural tube that lines the spinal cord, the brain (in the form of the meninges) and separates the different regions of the brain. The dural tube attaches to the sacrum, the upper cervical spine and the skull. It encloses the cerebrospinal fluid that flows through it.  When tension builds up in this layer of fascia it affects the brain and spinal cord and compromises the function of the central nervous system. This can affect nearly every other system in the body.</p>

    			<p>CranioSacral therapy was developed by an osteopathic physician Dr. John Upledger, a clinical researcher and professor of biomechanics at Michigan State University. He demonstrated that the tissues lining the spinal cord and the brain have a natural rhythm. The rhythm is caused by the continuous production and re-absorption of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. This filling and emptying occur at slightly different times, causing a slight rhythmic movement that can be palpated in the skull, and throughout the body. When there are restrictions in the fascia, this natural rhythm is altered.</p>

    			<p>During a CranioSacral therapy session the therapist carefully assesses the rhythm in different parts of the body to determine where the restrictions are and find the original source of  the dysfunction. Using light touch techniques, the therapist helps the body’s natural healing mechanism release the restriction and improve the function of the nervous system.</p>

    			<h2>About the Therapist</h2>
    			<img src="images/portrait.jpg">
    			<p>Hello, my name is Francoise Shapero.</p>

    			<p>I was born and raised in France and came to the US in my early twenties.   While I was raising my family I attended the University of Louisville where I earned a degree in  Physical Therapy.</p>

    			<p>I have been practicing Physical Therapy for the past 18 years in an outpatient setting treating patients with a variety of diagnoses including orthopedic, trauma, chronic pain (especially back and  neck), TMJ and  neurological disorders. For the  past  5 years I have treated women’s health issues with a focus on pelvic pain and incontinence.</p>

    			<p>Manual therapy has always been an essential part of the treatments that I provide. Over the years I have taken multiple continuing education courses to perfect my skills including courses for Cranio Sacral Therapy from the Upleger Institute.</p>

    			<p>Over and over, I have seen the efficient and transformative healing power of craniosacral therapy and myofascial release. I am exited  to make these treatments directly available to anyone who wants to improve their health and well being.</p>

    		<div id="session">
    			<h2>What to Expect from a Session</h2>
    			<p>The sessions take place in a private relaxing setting. You will lay on a comfortable, padded table and remain fully clothed. Light, loose-fitting clothing is preferable.</p>

    			<p>Using light hand contact, the therapist will assess tissue and fluid motion in different areas of your body to determine the sources of dysfunction.</p>

    			<p>A gentle, manual technique is then used to release restrictions in soft tissues, scar tissues, and joints. Depending on your own body awareness, you may or may not sense the gentle tissue motions initially. Most people are able to feel the releases, but if you do not feel them initially, you will become aware of them as you become more attuned to your body.</p>

    			<p>Craniosacral sessions are usually an hour or more.  At the initial visit you might benefit from a longer session. Children's sessions are usually 30 minutes.</p>

    			<p>Craniosacral therapy can be used on its own or in tandem with other therapies such as myofascial or scar release as needed  for further healing.</p>

    			<p>What you experience from a session and the number of sessions required to reach optimal well-being is highly individual, depending on your own body history.</p>

    			<p>The sessions are generally deeply relaxing, creating feelings of warmth or gentle pulsing in the area where the therapist is working.</p>
