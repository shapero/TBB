					<h2>Why a scooter?</h2>
						<p>Scooters are a fun, easy, and affordable way to get around! Experience the thrill of zooming down country lanes at 65+ miles an hour, avoid the pump with 100+ MPG, and beat traffic with the easy navigation and convenient size of your two-wheeled ride.</p>
					<h2>Do I need a motorcycle license?</h2>
						<p>Kentucky state law requires insurance and motorcycle licenses for all vehicles with an engine larger than 50ccs. Luckily, both are very easy to acquire! Insurance is available from all major auto insurers. To obtain a motorcycle permit, folow the directions below:</p>
						<ol>
							<a class="btn" href="http://kentuckystatepolice.org/pdf/2012_ky_drivers_manual_op.pdf"  target="_blank">Download the Kentucky Driver's Manual</a>
							<li>Read the "Motorcycle" section, starting at page 35.</li>
							<li>Visit the DMV and take the Motorcycle Permit written exam. A motorcycle permit allows you to operate a scooter with an engine larger than 50ccs, but does not allow you to have a passeneger. This is valid for two years, and renewable once for an additional year.</li>
							<li>After one month, take the practical exam and receive a motorcycle endoresement on your driver's license.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>If the scooter has an engine smaller than 50ccs, no motorcycle license is required - only a visiblity flag.
						<p>Please note that a driver's license is required to operate any motor vehicle on public roads.</p>
					<h2>Is financing available?</h2>
						<p>Yes! There are multiple options available:</p>
						<p>For Genuine, Vespa, and Piaggio scooters, financing is available through <a href="http://www.sheffieldfinancial.com">Sheffield Financial</a>, with applications available online or in-store.</p>
