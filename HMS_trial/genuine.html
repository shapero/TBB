				<h2>About Genuine Scooters</h2>
				<p>Genuine Scooters was founded by a couple of guys selling scooter parts out of an old warehouse in Chicago. They had one thing in mind: Bring a better scooter to the United States.</p>
				
				<p>The confidence Genuine has in its products is unparalleled in the industry. Every model comes with a 2-year Genuine Confidence Warranty and Roadside Assistance Program and there&apos;s a network of Genuine Authorized Dealers across the country to assist you with any of your scooter needs.</p>
